@kartikaypassi9861,"Amazing analysis! Will just add another point, in this era of high valuations for Tech businesses, everybody wants to be a tech business. However, you cannot ignore your primary business. In my opinion, the biggest reason for downfall of Wework was that they considered themselves a tech firm till the very end but in reality they were a real estate firm. Founders need to understand that just by using technology in your operations you do not become a tech firm!"

@jimanushmishra7066,bro make video on soft bank
@niharhingrajia8606,"The most important point i have is, please dont lose your primary aim. I think your channel must focus on large-volume-high-quality content than low-volume-netflix-level-content. Whatever u decide, please dont decrease the frequency or depth of the content. Rather i strongly feel that your viewers are ready for even more frequent and more in depth videos (maybe u can raise a poll about it).

Recommendations regarding the video quality can include better visual graphics and a better backdrop behind your chair.

Please hear me out. I feel your production quality right now is perfectly serving the purpose of giving better knowledge(i never felt even once that your video quality is bad or even mediocre). Why fix somethig that isn’t broke. My MOST IMPORTANT recommendation is to increase the number of videos and their depth. I think the net value addtion of your channel will increase the most if you increase the frequency and depth of videos

Also I just want to let you know that this content has been adding so much value you cant even imagine. Thank you so much for everything. Waiting for the next video😄"

@abhirajsutar8260,"Providing feedback on the production quality as per your request.
I liked the palette and animations and also other production quality. We have been following the channel for 2-3 years now.
The quality has only increased over time. I personally care about the video content in terms of Details, explanation and video structure. So that has always been your plus point. The content is what I personally care about not about visuals much. Like the base animations work just fine for me. But the sounds do matter to me, it drives the mood and tone of the video. And you did a great job for the sounds. This video was very very sound layup heavy. I don't want it. Basic tones and mood inflicting music are just fine. If processing the 170 sounds was difficult for your team, it's fine even with 50 sounds if the 170 was an overstretch for your team.

Rest is your decision, Netflix has a big budget for video producers to hire Sound Engineering firms. That's not your budget value, it's YouTube you primarily focus on.

All of this, just my opinion. I am not into Video production by profession but do watch a lot of documentaries and educational videos in Tech, Business and Geopolitics. Viewers Opinion!!"

But one request, please make a video on how to do research? even though things got clearer as I kept on learning, I thought something was lagging to make a big decision out of it, if you help us by making a video for that, It will be very helpful for us.

Because, when I read an annual report, it seems too overwhelming, it's not that I am not ready to spend enough time on that, It's that I don't know whether the thing I am doing is correct or not, also, I saw in our videos that there are different sources for information containing graphs and data, how would you get that, where to look at for reliable information and so on......

I hope you'll help us. Thank You."

I think in near future you should start a consulting company as you have deep insights in various fields..As USA got McKinsey, JP Morgan, Deloitte, BCG etc .India doesn't have any. I think Consulting industry is a trillion dollar opportunity as india is now a booming economy and many businesses can't afford those big giants. I just want to share this idea with you . I may be wrong also.All the best for your future endeavours"

@azoshin,"The reason for WeWork failure was that their real estate work was nothing unusual & had no competitive advantage compared to others. This long-term lease to short term model was nothing new. But WeWork tried to claim that it was a tech company using tech as a competitive advantage over others. They were yet another technology company trying to change the world.  Venture Capital funds were delighted and drank the kool-aid. This was a scam, plain & simple.  No different than VC funds enamored by Sam Bankman Fried and FTX. Except they scammed VC funds and not consumers and the VCs gave him a golden parachute to save their skins in the IPO"

@vimalrajs3014,"I think Adam wisely followed ""Business Entity Concept"", to benefit himself !"
@rickbhattacharya2334,This is a common Sillicon valley pump and dump scheme of most current start-ups. They don't make a single $ and live off investor money. When that's about to dry up founders and early investors leave with fat stacks and rest goes to hell.
@stannisbarracuda5693,It’s simple I see a think school video I click
@stryker_xxi,"Wework failed true but its CEO Adam did not, 14:11 he owned many properties himself, and 20:04 these landlord this is Adam himself is still making profits.
and what more interesting is that he pitched an Idea raised funds took PL at low intrests to buy properties for himself and then use his company funds to rent his own properties.
conclusion Wework failed but Adam didnt failed."

@rp10304,"Don't know much about US regulations, but the founder should be penalized. How can they simply file for bankruptcy. When Soft bank acquired the firm Wework, they knew it was in troubled waters and knew that the founder owned some of the property in his name and was making profits thru rental income. Something fishy."
